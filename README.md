## Hello! My name is Frost, I am from year 9 and im pursuing Com Sci track. I have no idea what im doing and no basics whatso ever despite learning Cs-50 for almost a year now. My goal is to attend any Ivy league university in my current field. Weather its, MIT , Carnige Mellon , Harvard , Yale I do not mind. In order to achieve my goals, it is one hell of a journey. Requiring a SAT score of atleast 1560 , Ministry level backing and ofcourse, an absurd amount of wealth. Incase you already didn't know, in order to attend a school of this league and prestige , not only that you need friends in **VERY _HIGH_ PLACES** such as the ***Prime minister*** , **top ministers** , ***important figures*** or an _alumni_. You also have to be fortunate enough to be born in an uppper upper middle class or a high class family. One hell of a journey, am I right? Oh hey, did I mention about the limited acceptance quotas they have for us asians per year? Don't even get me started about the scolarship and the competiton there actually is if you actually somehow got accepted ~~sighs~~ . Anyways, enough talking about the future, lets get back to the *present* . Currently, Im enrolled at The Newton Sixth Form School. I've chosen this school because this school matches my needs and desires of attending an Ivy league school. Since I am pursuing Com Sci track, I've taken Cs-50 classes and attending fundamental computer scienece class. Well, This is me. Wendnesday 17 August 2022  <sub> signing out </sub>
